# PHP

PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language that helps people make web pages more interactive by allowing them to do more intelligent, complex things. PHP code is run on the web server.

A website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website with no programming cannot do this without other complex things. Standard PHP file extensions are: .php .php3 or .phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.[4][5]

Its structure was influenced by many languages like C, Perl, Java, C++, and even Python. It is considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation.[6]

# History
PHP was first created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995.[7] It is now developed and improved by a large team of people. Its name at first stood for Personal Home Page, but it was later changed to PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor; using its old acronym in the new name.


## An example Hello World program:

  <?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
  ?>
  It is common to put PHP code inside a HTML document, for example:

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Hello World</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <?= '<p>Hello World</p>'; ?>
    </body>
  </html>
